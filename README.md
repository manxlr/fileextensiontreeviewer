# fileextensiontreeviewer
File Extension Tree Viewer is a Python-based GUI application that allows users to select a folder and view its file extensions in a collapsible tree structure. Each extension is displayed alongside the number of files it contains, and users can expand each node to see the names and full paths of the files.
